My approach,

1) Exploiting the fact that 2025 is a perfect square:
   2025 = (45)²

2) Breaking the number 45 into smaller numbers,
   = (5 x 9)²

3) Converting 9 to something within rule,
   = (5 x 3²)²

4) Distributing exponent 2 over the expression
   = (5² x 3²ˣ²)
   2025 = 5² x 3⁴ x 1

∴ All numbers used exactly once.
